# hello-world
My first hello world repository tutorial.
Hello everyone, my name is Byron Jackson I'm currently attending Columbus State University and I’m currently a Senior getting my Bachelor’s in Information Technology and I except to graduate this December. I currently work in the IT department at TSYS, and I work at Piedmont Columbus Regional part time. I plan opening up my Networking Business in the next 7 years. I like to mostly go to gym and play basketball on my off days. I plan on having a good semester and learning all about this class.
